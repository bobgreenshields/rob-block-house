  desc: |-
    An opening resembling a seat cut into the wall.  From close up air can be seen below the opening.  The view drops away to the river below.

  desc: |-
    Above the refuse chute is a large, flat, square stone in a chain, rope and leather harness.  This is attached to a winding-wheel on the wall.  It has a simple lever-release mechanism which drops the stone across the gap (winching it back up is rather harder).  The stoneâ€™s edges slide into a strong metal frame which prevents it being pushed over.

- title: "Floor level opening C"
  desc: |-
    The right-hand opening is at floor-level, much larger and the sky can be seen straight through it.  It has a wooden tray, with two handles at the near-end, lying along the meter-or-so long tunnel through the rock.  Rubbish is placed on the tray, which is then tipped up using the handles to dump rubbish out.
