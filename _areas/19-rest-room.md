A wooden staircase drops through the floor down to [7 Ground floor corridor]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _areas/07-corridor.md %})

Four guards are playing cards at the table.  They will be a little slow to respond but will defend themselves before shouting for Gren to sound the alarm.  He will then run off and start climbing the ladder.
